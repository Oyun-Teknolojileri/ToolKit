     * transformation that will most-likely be applied to buffers. This is only
     * a hint, the actual transformation applied might be different.
     *
     * INTENDED USE:
     *
     * The transform hint can be used by a producer, for instance the GLES
     * driver, to pre-rotate the rendering such that the final transformation
     * in the composer is identity. This can be very useful when used in
     * conjunction with the h/w composer HAL, in situations where it
     * cannot handle arbitrary rotations.
     *
     * 1. Before dequeuing a buffer, the GL driver (or any other ANW client)
     *    queries the ANW for NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT.
     *
     * 2. The GL driver overrides the width and height of the ANW to
     *    account for NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT. This is done by querying
     *    NATIVE_WINDOW_DEFAULT_{WIDTH | HEIGHT}, swapping the dimensions
     *    according to NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT and calling
     *    native_window_set_buffers_dimensions().
     *
     * 3. The GL driver dequeues a buffer of the new pre-rotated size.
     *
     * 4. The GL driver renders to the buffer such that the image is
     *    already transformed, that is applying NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT
     *    to the rendering.
     *
     * 5. The GL driver calls native_window_set_transform to apply
     *    inverse transformation to the buffer it just rendered.
     *    In order to do this, the GL driver needs
     *    to calculate the inverse of NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT, this is
     *    done easily:
     *
     *        int hintTransform, inverseTransform;
     *        query(..., NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT, &hintTransform);
     *        inverseTransform = hintTransform;
     *        if (hintTransform & HAL_TRANSFORM_ROT_90)
     *            inverseTransform ^= HAL_TRANSFORM_ROT_180;
     *
     *
     * 6. The GL driver queues the pre-transformed buffer.
     *
     * 7. The composer combines the buffer transform with the display
     *    transform.  If the buffer transform happens to cancel out the
     *    display transform then no rotation is needed.
