# ToolKit

<img align="left" width="48" height="48" src="https://github.com/Oyun-Teknolojileri/ToolKit/blob/master/Resources/Engine/Textures/Icons/app.png?raw=true">ToolKit is a 3d editor & interactive application development platform. It allows users to create 3d scenes and bring in the interactivity via C++ plug-ins.

## Motivation

### Simplicity

Most games, projects using Unity, UE4 or even Godot, don't need all those tools and functionalities. Having a far simple game engine, increases your comprehension of the framework & tools, which in return gives you more freedom to do things your way. This approach may not be suitable for professional game studios, however it is very suitable for indies whom after unique projects.

This project has a unique goal which is keeping all the source code under 30k lines of code excluding dependencies. Instead of adding more capabilities, tools and getting more complicated, ToolKit will be oriented towards simplicity, performance and being/staying modern.

### Community

Bringing like minded people together around a project outputs invaluable assets as one can observe from projects like Blender & Godot. So the project's motivation is to bring people together who after uniqueness, simplicity, modernity and collaborative effort to create something exceptional.

## Platforms

ToolKit does not have any Windows dependency and can be build for Linux and Mac easily. However my main OS is Windows, compiling from source and publishing the created apps will be done from Windows and I don't have any plans to support other OS anytime soon.
ToolKit can pubish for:

- Windows executable
- Web html + .wasm or .js

Although it's possible, publishing to these platforms are not streamlined, still a lot of manual configuration and building is needed. Publishing for Android is on the way.
